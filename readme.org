Not a product per-se, but from the discussion, the prototype seems interesting. It is an attempt to create a densely connected Digital Garden. (The term digital garden has become a popular term for describing websites that incorporate multiple facets of a person’s digital space like notes, blog etc into a single thing and allows visitors to stroll through them seamlessly like a garden with densely connected graph like structure. [This article](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) from [[https://nesslabs.com/author/annelaure][Anne-Laure Le Cunff]] has an excellent explanation of it).

Some examples of digital garden:
